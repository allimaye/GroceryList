# GroceryList
Grocery List Maker is an Android app which simplifies the process of creating and storing a grocery list. The user selects a food group category, and chooses the items they want from that category as well as the quantity of each item through a simple and user friendly UI. Conveniently, after creating a grocery list the user can send the grocery list to another person if required via SMS! The app saves the user's groceries for future use. The list maker even prioritizes the most recently used items by bringing them to the top of the list for each category.
